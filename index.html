        <p>Having taught at different academic centers and schools and Universities for over twenty years, I have
            developed a wide range of skills that would meet, and exceed the expectations for the role. In my present
            role as a University Professor for Azad University of Tehran, Iran, I have had many achievements, including
            more than fifteen articles published in scholarly journals and numerous international conference
            presentations and a few published books.</p>
        <p>Would relish the opportunity to bring this level of success to your University. If you would like to get in
            touch to discuss my application and to arrange an interview, you can contact me.</p>
